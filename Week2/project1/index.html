            <h3>We Live in a Greenhouse</h3>
            <p>Life on Earth depends on energy coming from the Sun. About half the light reaching Earth's 
                <br>atmosphere passes through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and then 
                <br>radiated upward in the form of infrared heat. About <b>90 percent</b> of this heat is then absorbed by 
                <br>the greenhouse gases and radiated back toward the surface.
            </p>
            <p>Scientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century to the human 
                <br>expansion of the "greenhouse effect" â€” warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat 
                <br>radiating from Earth toward space.
            </p>
            <p>Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping. Long-lived gases that remain semi-
                <br>permanently in the atmosphere and do not respond physically or chemically to changes in 
                <br>temperature are described as "forcing" climate change. Gases, such as water vapor, which 
                <br>respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are seen as "feedbacks."
            </p>
            <p>Gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect include:</p>
                <ol class="list">
                    <li>Nitrouse oxide</li>
                    <li>Carbon dioxide</li>
                    <li>Methane</li>
                    <li>Water Vapor</li>
                </ol>
